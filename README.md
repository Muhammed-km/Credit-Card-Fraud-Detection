This credit card fraud detection project utilizes the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm to identify fraudulent transactions. The Isolation Forest algorithm is effective in isolating anomalies within a dataset by constructing random forests. By leveraging this algorithm, the project aims to accurately detect and flag suspicious credit card transactions, thereby enhancing fraud prevention measures.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle. It provides a comprehensive collection of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones, making it suitable for training and evaluating the fraud detection model.
