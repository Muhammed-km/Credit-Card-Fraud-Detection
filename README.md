This credit card fraud detection project utilizes the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm to identify fraudulent transactions. The Isolation Forest algorithm is effective in isolating anomalies within a dataset by constructing random forests. By leveraging this algorithm, the project aims to accurately detect and flag suspicious credit card transactions, thereby enhancing fraud prevention measures.
