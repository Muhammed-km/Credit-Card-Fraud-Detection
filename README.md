This credit card fraud detection project utilizes the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm to identify fraudulent transactions. The Isolation Forest algorithm is effective in isolating anomalies within a dataset by constructing random forests. By leveraging this algorithm, the project aims to accurately detect and flag suspicious credit card transactions, thereby enhancing fraud prevention measures.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle. It provides a comprehensive collection of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones, making it suitable for training and evaluating the fraud detection model.
